**SAID: Scientific Academic Integrity Disclosure**

The SAID framework is a Transparent AI-Audited Framework designed to uphold scientific integrity and reproducible research on GitHub. 

**Overview of the SOFT MANIFESTO:** 

The SOFT MANIFESTO (Scientific Academic Integrity Disclosure) is a voluntary, open framework that documents human oversight and computational provenance for each research output. Developed based on the principles of HUMINT governance and AI auditability, SAID empowers students to disclose—not defend—the role automation plays in their work. This protocol provides a straightforward template for reports, theses, and publications, promoting transparency while minimizing bureaucratic processes.

**Disclose, Not Defend:**

To disclose means to advocate from a position of understanding, indicating mastery over the subject matter. This approach encourages open discourse and the potential for critique or rejection. Embracing these values can help academics balance epistemic value with scientific structure. Without an iterative process of epistemological exploration, a cohesive definition of science cannot emerge. This concept is still a work in progress.

**Soft Manifesto Approach:**

The Soft Manifesto represents an edge-vectored approach to balancing certain values with the uncertainties that adaptation may introduce. External forces, such as new technologies or paradigm shifts, can challenge the epistemic origins from a standpoint of resistance. In this context, epistemic value may be treated as negative relative to a starting point that exists above zero, creating a complex interplay of values over time. This idea is also still under development.

**License Intent:**

SAID is publicly released for transparency, not for reuse. By selecting “No License” on GitHub, the author explicitly reserves all rights, stating that no existing open-source license appropriately represents the project’s principles. A formal SAID License will govern any permitted use.

**My Intent:**

I aim to implement this framework into agile development, access activities through WSU Rally Psychology, recruit club members, develop training for officers (whether on-site or remote), find an advisor, and recruit three representatives at campuses to be announced.
