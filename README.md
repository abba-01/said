# SAID is the SCIENTIFIC ACADEMIC INTEGRITY DISCLOSURE 

**Transparent AI-Audited Framework for Scientific Integrity and Reproducible Research on GitHub**

The SOFT MANIFESTO (Scientific Academic Integrity Disclosure) is a voluntary, open framework designed to document human oversight and computational provenance for every research output. Developed from the principles of HUMINT governance and AI auditability, SAID empowers students to disclose—not defend—the role of automation in their work. The protocol offers a straightforward template for reports, theses, and publications, promoting transparency without unnecessary bureaucracy.

**Disclose, Not Defend:** To disclose is to advocate from a position of understanding. It implies mastery, enabling open discourse and the possibility of critique or rejection. These values can help academics navigate the balance between epistemic value and scientific structure. Without the iterative process of epistemological exploration, a cohesive definition of science cannot form. This idea is still a work in progress.

*Soft Manifesto:* This represents an edge-vectored approach to balancing nominal certainty values with the uncertainty that adaptation may introduce. An outside force, such as new technology or a paradigm shift, can challenge the epistemic origins from a standpoint of resistance. In this context, the epistemic value may be treated as negative relative to a starting point that exists after zero, creating a complex interplay of values over time. This concept is also still a work in progress.

## License Intent

SAID is released publicly for transparency, not for reuse.
By selecting “No License” on GitHub, the author explicitly reserves all rights
and declares that no existing open-source license adequately represents the
project’s principles. A formal SAID License governs any permitted use.
