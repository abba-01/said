# SAID is the SCIENTIFIC ACADEMIC INTEGRITY DISCLOSURE 

Transparent AI-audited framework for scientific integrity and reproducible research on GitHub.

## License Intent

SAID is released publicly for transparency, not for reuse.
By selecting “No License” on GitHub, the author explicitly reserves all rights
and declares that no existing open-source license adequately represents the
project’s principles. A formal SAID License governs any permitted use.
